# PyCompound
A Python-based tool for spectral library matching, PyCompound is available in two versions: a command-line interface and Python modules for integration into custom code. It performs spectral library matching to identify chemical compounds, offering a range of spectrum preprocessing transformations and similarity measures, including Cosine and three entropy-based similarity measures. PyCompound supports both high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data (e.g., LC-MS/MS) and nominal-resolution mass spectrometry (NRMS) data (e.g., GC-MS).

## 2. Functionality

<a name="spec-preprocessing-transformations"></a>
## 2.1 Spectrum Preprocessing Transformations
The following spectrum preprocessing transformations are offered:

-   Filtering: Given user-defined parameters (mz_min,mz_max),
    (int_min,int_max) and spectrum $I$ with m/z values
    $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$,
    the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$ consists of the peaks
    $(m_{i},x_{i})$ in $I$ such that mz_min $\leq m_{i}\leq$ mz_max and
    int_min $\leq x_{i}\leq$ int_max.
    -   Weight Factor Transformation: Given a pair of user-defined weight
    factor parameters $(\text{a,b})$ and spectrum $I$ with m/z values
    $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$,
    the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$ has the same m/z values as $I$
    and has intensities given by
    $I^{\star}:=(m_{1}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{1}^{\text{b}},m_{2}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{2}^{\text{b}},...,m_{n}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{n}^{\text{b}})$.

-   Low-Entropy Transformation: Given a user-defined low-entropy
    threshold parameter $T$ and spectrum $I$ with intensities
    $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, $\sum_{i=1}^nx_i = 1$, and Shannon
    entropy $H_{Shannon}(I)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\cdot ln(x_{i})$, the
    transformed spectrum intensities
    $I^{\star}=(x_{1}^{\star},x_{2}^{\star},...,x_{n}^{\star})$ are such
    that, for all $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$, $x_{i}^{\star}=x_{i}$ if
    $H_{Shannon}(I)\geq T$ and
    $x_{i}^{\star}=x_{i}^{\frac{1+H_{Shannon}(I)}{1+T}}$ if
    $H_{Shannon}(I)<T$.

-   Centroiding (only applicable to HRMS data): Given a user-defined
    window-size parameter $w_{centroiding}$ and a spectrum $I$ with m/z
    values $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities
    $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$
    merges adjacent peaks $(m_{i},x_{i}),(m_{i+1},x_{i+1})$ into the
    peak
    $(\frac{m_{i}\cdot x_{i}+m_{i+1}\cdot x_{i+1}}{x_{i}+x_{i+1}},x_{i}+x_{i+1})$
    if $|m_{i}-m_{i+1}|< w_{centroiding}$ for
    $i\in\{1,2,...,n-1\}$. This centroiding procedure generalizes to
    more than two peaks whose m/z values are within a distance
    $w_{centroiding}$ of each other.

-   Noise Removal: Given a user-defined noise removal parameter $r$ and
    a spectrum $I$ with intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, noise
    removal removes peaks from $I$ with
    $x_{j}< r\cdot\text{max}(\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\})$ for
    $j\in\{1,2,...,n\}$.

-   Matching (only applicable to HRMS data): Given a user-defined
    window-size parameter $w_{matching}$ and two spectra $I$, $J$ with
    m/z ratios $(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}), (b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m})$ and
    intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}), (y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m})$,
    respectively, of which we would like to measure the similarity
    between, the matching procedure outputs two spectra
    $I^{\star},J^{\star}$ containing the same number of peaks with
    $I^{\star}$ and $J^{\star}$ having transformed intensities and
    identical m/z ratios. Specifically, for a given peak $(a_{i},x_{i})$
    of $I$, if there are no peaks $(b_{j},y_{j})$ in $J$ with
    $|a_{i}-b_{j}|< w_{matching}$, then the peak $(a_{i},x_{i})$
    remains in $I^{\star}$ and the peak $(a_{i},0)$ is included in
    $J^{\star}$. If there is at least one peak $(b_{j},y_{j})$ with
    $|a_{i}-b_{j}|< w_{matching}$, then the peak $(a_{i},x_{i})$
    remains in $I^{\star}$ and the peak
    $(a_{i},\sum_{j\text{ such that }|a_{i}-b_{j}|< w_{matching}}b_{j})$
    is included in $J^{\star}$. This procedure is applied when
    transposing the roles of $I$ and $J$ as well.

<a name="similarity-measures"></a>
## 2.2 Similarity Measures
Given a pair of processed spectra intensities
$I=(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}), J=(b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
with $0\leq a_{i},b_{i}\leq 1$ for all $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$ and
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}=1$, PyCompound provides
functionality for computing the following similarity measures:

-   Cosine Similarity Measure:

```math
S_{Cosine}(I,J)=\frac{I\circ J}{|I|_{2}\cdot |J|_{2}}
```
where multiplication in the numerator refers to the dot product $I\circ J=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+...+a_{n}b_{n}$ of $I$ and $J$ and multiplication in the denominator refers to multiplication of the $L^{2}$-norms of $I$ and $J$, $\vert I\vert_{2}=\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+...+a_{n}^{2}}, \vert J\vert_{2}=\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+...+b_{n}^{2}}$.

-   Shannon Entropy Similarity Measure:

```math
S_{Shannon}(I,J) = 1-\frac{2\cdot H_{Shannon}\left(\frac{I+J}{2}\right) - H_{Shannon}(I)-H_{Shannon}(J)}{ln(4)},
```

```math
H_{Shannon}(I)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\cdot ln(a_{i})
```

-    Tsallis Entropy Similarity Measure:

```math
S_{Tsallis}(I,J,q)=1-\frac{2\times H_{Tsallis}(I/2+J/2,q)-H_{Tsallis}(I,q)-H_{Tsallis}(J,q)}{N_{Tsallis}(I,J,q)},
```

```math
N_{Tsallis}(I,J,q):=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(2\left(\frac{a_{i}}{2}\right)^{q}+2\left(\frac{b_{i}}{2}\right)^{q}-a_{i}^{q}-b_{i}^{q}\right)}{1-q},
```

```math
H_{Tsallis}(I,q)=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{q}\right)-1}{1-q},
```

```math
q\neq 1, \ q>0
```

-   RÃ©nyi Entropy Similarity Measure:

```math
S_{Renyi}(I,J,q)=1-\frac{2\times H_{Renyi}(I/2+J/2,q)-H_{Renyi}(I,q)-H_{Renyi}(J,q)}{N_{Renyi}(I,J,q)},
```

```math
N_{Renyi}(I,J,q):=\left(\frac{1}{1-q}\right)\left(2\times ln\left(\sum_{i}(a_{i}/2)^{q}+\sum_{j}(b_{j}/2)^{q}\right)-ln(\sum_{i}a_{i}^{q})-ln(\sum_{i}b_{i}^{q})\right),
```

```math
H_{Renyi}(I,q)=\frac{1}{1-q}ln(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{q}),
```

```math
q\neq 1, \ q>0
```

## 3. Usage
This repository has three main capabilities:
1. Converting raw data to the necessary format for spectral library matching
2. Running spectral library matching to identify compounds based on their mass spectrometry data
3. Plotting a query spectrum vs. a reference spectrum before and after preprocessing transformations.

These tasks are implemented separately for the cases of (i) NRMS and (ii) HRMS data due to the different spectrum preprocessing transformations stemming from a different format in the mass to charge (m/z) ratios in L=NRMS vs HRMS data. Example scripts which implement these tasks can be found in the pycompound/tests directory.

<a name="process-data"></a>
### 3.1 Obtain LC-MS/MS or GC-MS library from MGF, mzML, or cdf file
To obtain a CSV file of LC-MS/MS spectra in the format necessary for spectral library matching from raw data in the form of an mgf, mzML, or cdf file, one can run:
```
from pycompound_fy7392.build_library import build_library_from_raw_data

build_library_from_raw_data(input_path='path_to_input_file', output_path='path_to_output_file', is_reference=False)
```

Parameter descriptions are as follows:

--input_path: Path to input file (must be either mgf, mzMZ, or cdf file). Mandatory argument.

--output_path: Path to output CSV file. Default: current working directory.

--is_reference: Boolean flag indicating whether IDs of spectra should be written to output. Only pass True if building a reference library with known compound IDs. Only applicable to MGF files. Options: \'True\', \'False\'. Optional argument. Default: False.


Some example MGF files one can use to build an LC-MS/MS library can be found from the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) databases here: [https://external.gnps2.org/gnpslibrary](https://external.gnps2.org/gnpslibrary). Some example mzML files one can use to build an LC-MS/MS library can be found in this repository: [https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzML](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzML). The script tests/test_build_libraries.py demonstrates this usage.

LC-MS/MS and GC-MS reference libraries are available at the Zenodo database ([https://zenodo.org/records/12786324](https://zenodo.org/records/12786324)). The reference libraries available in PyCompound's GitHub repository are shortened versions of these reference libraries due to GitHub's limited storage.

<a name="run-spec-lib-matching"></a>
### 3.2 Run spectral library matching
The files tests/test_spec_lib_matching.py tests/example_code_for_python_use.py demonstrate how some of the spectrum preprocessing functionality and similarity measures can be implemented. The two main functions - one for HRMS data and one for NRMS data - can be implemented as:
```
from pycompound_fy7392.spec_lib_matching import run_spec_lib_matching_on_HRMS_data
from pycompound_fy7392.spec_lib_matching import run_spec_lib_matching_on_NRMS_data

        spectrum_preprocessing_order='FCNMWL',
        high_quality_reference_library=False,
        mz_min=0,
        mz_max=9999999,
        int_min=0,

        LET_threshold=0.0,
        entropy_dimension=1.1,
        n_top_matches_to_save=1,
        print_id_results=False,
        output_identification=None,
        output_similarity_scores=None)

run_spec_lib_matching_on_NRMS_data(
        query_data='path_to_query_library',
        reference_data='path_to_reference_library',
        likely_reference_IDs=None,
        similarity_measure='cosine',
        spectrum_preprocessing_order='FNLW',
        high_quality_reference_library=False,
        mz_min=0,
        mz_max=9999999,
        int_min=0,
        int_max=9999999,

        print_id_results=False,
        output_identification=None,
        output_similarity_scores=None)
```

Parameter descriptions are as follows:

--query_data (mandatory argument):
  * HRMS case: mgf, mzML, or csv file of query mass spectrum/spectra to be identified. If csv file, must have 3 columns with each row corresponding to a single ion fragment of a mass spectrum, the left-most column containing an identifier, the middle columns corresponding to the mass to charge (m/z) ratios, and the right-most column containing the intensities. For example, if spectrum A has 3 ion fragments, then there would be three rows in this CSV file corresponding to spectrum A.
  * NRMS case: cdf or csv file of query mass spectrum/spectra to be identified. If csv file, each row should correspond to a mass spectrum with the left-most column containing an identifier and each of the other columns containing the intensity with respect to a single m/z ratio.

--reference_data (mandatory argument): Same format csv file as query_data except of reference library spectra.

--likely_reference_IDs: CSV file with one column containing the IDs of a subset of all compounds in the reference_data to be used in spectral library matching. Each ID in this file must be an ID in the reference library. Default: None (i.e. default is to use entire reference library)

--similarity_measure: \'cosine\', \'shannon\', \'renyi\', and \'tsallis\'. Default: cosine.

--spectrum_preprocessing_order: The spectrum preprocessing transformations and the order in which they are to be applied. Note that these transformations are applied prior to computing similarity scores. Format must be a string with 2-6 characters chosen from C, F, M, N, L, W representing centroiding, filtering based on mass/charge and intensity values, matching, noise removal, low-entropy trannsformation, and weight-factor-transformation, respectively. For example, if \'WCM\' is passed, then each spectrum will undergo a weight factor transformation, then centroiding, and then matching. Note that if an argument is passed, then \'M\' must be contained in the argument, since matching is a required preprocessing step in spectral library matching of HRMS data. Furthermore, \'C\' must be performed before matching since centroiding can change the number of ion fragments in a given spectrum. Note that C and M are not applicable to NRMS data. Default: FCNMWL for HRMS and FNLW for NRMS.')

--high_quality_reference_library: True/False flag indicating whether the reference library is considered to be of high quality. If True, then the spectrum preprocessing transformations of filtering and noise removal are performed only on the query spectrum/spectra. If False, all spectrum preprocessing transformations specified will be applied to both the query and reference spectra. Default: False')

--mz_min: Remove all peaks with mass/charge value less than mz_min in each spectrum. Default: 0

--mz_max: Remove all peaks with mass/charge value greater than mz_max in each spectrum. Default: 9999999

--int_min: Remove all peaks with intensity value less than int_min in each spectrum. Default: 0

--int_max: Remove all peaks with intensity value greater than int_max in each spectrum. Default: 9999999

--window_size_centroiding (only for HRMS): Window size parameter used in centroiding a given spectrum. Default: 0.5

--window_size_matching (only for HRMS): Window size parameter used in matching a query spectrum and a reference library spectrum. Default: 0.5

--noise_threshold: Ion fragments (i.e. points in a given mass spectrum) with intensity less than max(intensities)*noise_threshold are removed. Default: 0.0

--wf_mz: Mass/charge weight factor parameter. Default: 0.0

--wf_intensity: Intensity weight factor parameter. Default: 0.0

--LET_threshold: Low-entropy transformation threshold parameter. Spectra with Shannon entropy less than LET_threshold are transformed according to intensitiesNew=intensitiesOriginal^{(1+S)/(1+LET_threshold)}. Default: 0.0

--entropy_dimension: Entropy dimension parameter. Must have positive value other than 1. When the entropy dimension is 1, then Renyi and Tsallis entropy are equivalent to Shannon entropy. Therefore, this parameter only applies to the renyi and tsallis similarity measures. This parameter will be ignored if similarity measure cosine or shannon is chosen. Default: 1.1

--n_top_matches_to_save: The number of top matches to report. For example, if n_top_matches_to_save=5, then for each query spectrum, the five reference spectra with the largest similarity with the given query spectrum will be reported. Default: 1

--print_id_results: Flag that prints identification results if True. Default: False

For a user who may wish to incorporate our transformations and similarity measures directly in their python code similar to the example script tests/example_code_for_python_use.py, the available transformations and similarity measures are:

Parameter descriptions are as follows:

--query_data (mandatory argument):
  * HRMS case: mgf, mzML, or csv file of query mass spectrum/spectra to be identified. If csv file, must have 3 columns with each row corresponding to a single ion fragment of a mass spectrum, the left-most column containing an identifier, the middle columns corresponding to the mass to charge (m/z) ratios, and the right-most column containing the intensities. For example, if spectrum A has 3 ion fragments, then there would be three rows in this CSV file corresponding to spectrum A.
  * NRMS case: cdf or csv file of query mass spectrum/spectra to be identified. If csv file, each row should correspond to a mass spectrum with the left-most column containing an identifier and each of the other columns containing the intensity with respect to a single m/z ratio.

--reference_data (mandatory argument): Same format CSV file as query_data except of reference library spectra.

--similarity_measure: \'cosine\', \'shannon\', \'renyi\', and \'tsallis\'. Default: cosine.

--spectrum_preprocessing_order: The spectrum preprocessing transformations and the order in which they are to be applied. Note that these transformations are applied prior to computing similarity scores. Format must be a string with 2-6 characters chosen from C, F, M, N, L, W representing centroiding, filtering based on mass/charge and intensity values, matching, noise removal, low-entropy trannsformation, and weight-factor-transformation, respectively. For example, if \'WCM\' is passed, then each spectrum will undergo a weight factor transformation, then centroiding, and then matching. Note that if an argument is passed, then \'M\' must be contained in the argument, since matching is a required preprocessing step in spectral library matching of HRMS data. Furthermore, \'C\' must be performed before matching since centroiding can change the number of ion fragments in a given spectrum. Note that C and M are not applicable to NRMS data. Default: FCNMWL for HRMS and FNLW for NRMS.')

--high_quality_reference_library: True/False flag indicating whether the reference library is considered to be of high quality. If True, then the spectrum preprocessing transformations of filtering and noise removal are performed only on the query spectrum/spectra. If False, all spectrum preprocessing transformations specified will be applied to both the query and reference spectra. Default: False')

--mz_min: Remove all peaks with mass/charge value less than mz_min in each spectrum. Default: 0

--mz_max: Remove all peaks with mass/charge value greater than mz_max in each spectrum. Default: 9999999

--int_min: Remove all peaks with intensity value less than int_min in each spectrum. Default: 0

--int_max: Remove all peaks with intensity value greater than int_max in each spectrum. Default: 9999999

--window_size_centroiding (only for HRMS): Window size parameter used in centroiding a given spectrum. Default: 0.5

--window_size_matching (only for HRMS): Window size parameter used in matching a query spectrum and a reference library spectrum. Default: 0.5

--noise_threshold: Ion fragments (i.e. points in a given mass spectrum) with intensity less than max(intensities)*noise_threshold are removed. Default: 0.0

--wf_mz: Mass/charge weight factor parameter. Default: 0.0

--wf_intensity: Intensity weight factor parameter. Default: 0.0

--LET_threshold: Low-entropy transformation threshold parameter. Spectra with Shannon entropy less than LET_threshold are transformed according to intensitiesNew=intensitiesOriginal^{(1+S)/(1+LET_threshold)}. Default: 0.0

--entropy_dimension: Entropy dimension parameter. Must have positive value other than 1. When the entropy dimension is 1, then Renyi and Tsallis entropy are equivalent to Shannon entropy. Therefore, this parameter only applies to the renyi and tsallis similarity measures. This parameter will be ignored if similarity measure cosine or shannon is chosen. Default: 1.1

--y_axis_transformation: transformation to apply to y-axis (i.e. intensity axis) of plots. Options: \'normalized\', \'none\', \'log10\', and \'sqrt\'. Default: normalized.')

--output_path: path to output PDF file containing the plots of the spectra before and after preprocessing transformations. If no argument is passed, then the plots will be saved to the PDF ./spectrum1_{spectrum_ID1}_spectrum2_{spectrum_ID2}_plot.pdf in the current working directory.

An example of such a generated plot is seen below.

This plot compares two MS/MS spectra: Spectrum ID 1 (unknown, in blue) and Spectrum ID 2 (Hectochlorin M+H, in red). The top panel displays the untransformed spectra, while the bottom panel shows the transformed spectra following preprocessing steps. The footnote details are as follows:

-   Filtering: Given user-defined parameters (mz_min,mz_max),

-   Similarity Measure: Cosine -- The similarity measure used is cosine correlation.

-   Similarity Score: 0.9946 -- The cosine similarity score between the two transformed spectra.

-   Spectrum Preprocessing Order: FCNMWL -- The sequence of preprocessing steps applied: Filtering (F), Centroiding (C), Noise removal (N), Matching (M), Weight factor transformation (W), and Low-entropy transformation (L).

-   High Quality Reference Library: False -- Both query and reference spectra underwent the same preprocessing transformations.

-   Window Size (Centroiding): 0.5 -- A 0.5 Da window was used for centroiding peaks.

-   Window Size (Matching): 0.5 -- Peaks were aligned using a 0.5 Da m/z tolerance window.

-   Raw-Scale M/Z Range: [217.7, 628.8] -- The maximum and minimum of m/z values of peaks with non-zero intensities.

-   Raw-Scale Intensity Range: [3885.0, 5549140] -- The maximum and minimum of absolute non-zero intensity values of the raw spectra before normalization.

-   Noise Threshold: 0.0 -- No noise threshold was applied.

-   Weight Factors (m/z, intensity): (0.0, 1.0) -- Non-zero intensities were transformed using weights of 0.0 for m/z and 1.0 for intensity.

-   Low-Entropy Threshold: 0.0 -- No low-entropy transformation was applied.
